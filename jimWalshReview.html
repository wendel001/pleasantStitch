enter-tainment it takes some detective                     work to recognize true moments of change, one of which happened                     this week.<br>                    </span></p>                  <p><span class="copyBk">On Tuesday, Maverick Records released                     &quot;Don't Tell Me,&quot; the second single from Madonna's                     latest album, &quot;Music.&quot; Co-written by Madonna's brother-in-law,                     Joe Henry, &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; is a pastiche of elec-tronic                     warbles and wrecked sounds. The production is purposefully                     unconventional and fragmented; it starts with a pretty acoustic                     gui-tar that is quickly sabo-taged by the sound of the CD                     skipping, which contin-ues throughout the track. So authentic                     is the effect that many listeners thought they'd purchased                     a dam-aged CD, only to be told by record-store clerks, &quot;That's                     how it's supposed to sound.&quot;<br>                    </span></p>                  <p><span class="copyBk">Now this song, with these sounds, these                     scarred sounds of confusion and imperfection, is being played                     on every Top 40 station in the world. Think about what that                     means: Not only are our tastes being challenged and reconfig-ured,                     but our collective way of listening is being attuned to a                     new way of hearing things What once was a flaw is now art.                     What once was annoying is now a hit record.<br>                    &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; is a brilliantly bizarre bit of                     production work, and it comes just in time The stop-start                     nature of &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; eerily refracts the times                     we live in, right down to the stop-start nature of the presidential                     non-election. We hunger for new sounds to describe the state                     we find ourselves in, a perpetual state of feel-ing like we're                     skating on thin ice or that we're all plate jugglers, and                     the plates have gone up in the air one last time. Will we                     catch them, or will they fall?<br>                    In that sense, the Madonna single may prove to be the most                     groundbreaking single of the year and could blow wide open                     the doors for new ideas, sounds and music. Because if that                     song is embraced by the masses the way her first single, &quot;Music,&quot;                     was, if the sound of a damaged CD skipping over a pretty melody                     becomes mainstream, that means the rules have changed forever.<br>                    </span></p>                  <p><span class="copyBk">Into this brave new world, this marvelous                     mess, comes the local band Pleasant Stitch. The four-piece                     (singer/sample player Sarah Jane Hill, bassist/synthesizer                     player Carty Fox, drummer Will Pierce, keyboardist Bob DeMaa)                     can loosely be described as an electronica out-fit, but don't                     hold them to it. DeMaa learned his recording chops working                     at &quot;Funkytown&quot; studios and played in the local band                     Overblue with Fox, who worked at the Twin/Tone Records Group.                     The two hooked up with Pierce, who had also done time in var-ious                     local bands, and started recording. They put an ad in City                     Pages, looking for a singer, and found Hill, a Portland native                     who had just moved to Minneapolis from Los Angeles, where                     she worked as an actress and jazz singer.<br>                    </span></p>                  <p><span class="copyBk">The final lineup came together in February                     1998, but in May, the band suffered a setback when Fox was                     diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor and underwent chemotherapy                     and radiation treatment for nine months. The other three musicians                     continued to work and record with Fox in mind. When he returned                     (&quot;I'm OK, I've got another MRI next week,&quot; he says,                     knocking on wood), the group recorded their debut, which was                     released last week.<br>                    All told, the foursome spent two years mak-ing &quot;Pleasant                     Stitch,&quot; and it shows. It is multi-layered work with                     a lot of craft at the core. Nothing is tossed off; it is a                     purposeful project from start to finish, and it rewards listeners                     with something new every time out. </span><br>                  </p>                  <p><br>                  </p>                  </td>                <td width="15" valign="top" height="1224">&nbsp;</td>                <td width="229" valign="top" height="1224">                   <p>&nbsp;</p>                  <p><span class="copyBk">It is a record of sounds, not necessarily                     songs, but the sounds make themselves into songs.<br>                    Hill sounds like a jazz singer, but a jazz singer for these                     times. There is a classicism about her, but also something                     thoroughly mod-ern. Her voice and haiku dip and rise with                     the music and serve as instruments, adding to the lush, exquisite                     soundscapes.<br>                    &quot;The thing that I liked about it, and still like is that                     everything really matters,&quot; says Hill, sit-ting with                     her bandmates in a coffee shop near the band's Minneapolis                     rehearsal space. &quot;Every-thing is really well thought-out.                     There's a reason, and everyone knows the rea-son, and I could                     tell that right away. When they gave me their demo, it was                     huge. I had to do something to it, but I had to have a reason                     for doing it. I had to fig-ure out what their reason was and                     put words and melody to whatev-er their reason was. It's not                     at all thrown together.&quot;</span></p>                  <p><span class="copyBk">The Twin Cities have produced a number                     of memorable electronic outfits, from Psykosonik to Red Red                     Groovy to Brother Sun Sister Moon, and the current guard of                     the Busy Signals, Astronaut Wife and Triangle, not to mention                     the thriving DJ scene led by DJ ESP Woody McBride. It is a                     blast of the nearly indescribable, where elitist factions                     war about terms such as house, techno, drum 'n' bass and ambient,                     all of which has been kept underground by a local music scene                     that has been built on rock.<br>                    That underground status is per-haps best exemplified by the                     fact that Pleasant Stitch - who renounce any labels or genres,                     including electronica - has played regularly over the past                     two years, including shows at First Avenue's Mainroom, the                     7th St. Entry, the Weisman Art Museum and several of the Future                     Perfect music festivals. Still, their profile remains low.                     And not by their choice.<br>                    &quot;It's so strange, because every time we play a show,                     there's peo-ple who say, 'Have you been around?,' &quot; says                     Hill with great exasperation. &quot;I'm like, 'God, I feel                     like my throat is sore.'&#148;<br>                    &quot;We've played out at least every other month for the                     past two years,&quot; says Fox.<br>                    &quot;We set up an electronic show-case at First Avenue with                     five bands, and 500 people showed up,&quot; says DeMaa. &quot;But                     it's still hard to get clubs to book us.&quot;<br>                    &quot;It's hard to think about how many Brother Sun Sister                     Moons or Pleasant Stitches might he out there, but there's                     absolutely no support for it,&quot; says Hill. &quot;It's                     hard to hang your wash out to see what everybody thinks.&quot;<br>                    That may change with the release of &quot;Pleasant Stitch,&quot;                     which, like all the best music, cre-ates a spiritual pact                     with the lis-tener and seeks to make the lis-tener an equal                     partner in the music&#146;s interpretation. For exam-ple,                     track three, &quot;Wash,&quot; begins with the sound of a                     buzzing guitar chord being plugged, and unplugged, into an                     amp. It is an irresistible morsel of ear candy, poetic in                     its simplicity and unto itself nothing special.<br>                    But heard amid the context of modern music, it could be a                     com-mentary on electronic artists' his-toric ghettoization                     by rockers and the oft-made assertion by electron-ic artists                     that rock 'n' roll was the first electronic music, since elec-tric                     guitars are, well, electronic instruments.<br>                    That dynamic was poignantly illustrated in the band's spartan                     rehearsal space the other night. As Hill, Fox, Pierce and                     DeMaa set up their gear, bursting through the walls was the                     roar of two or three speed-metal bands in full practice flush,                     doing their homework on Dio or Metallica or whoever.<br>                    But in a matter of moments, the sounds fashioned by Pleasant                     Stitch made those guys sound like the Glenn Miller Orchestra                     fend-ing off rock 'n' roll or a broken record in the age of                     skipping CDs.<br>                    Jim Walsh &#150; Pioneer Press<br>                    </span><span class="copyBoldBk"><img src="images/main/images/spacer.gif" width="50" height="18"></span><span class="copyBk">                     </span></p>                </td>                <td width="44" valign="top" height="1224">&nbsp;</td>              </tr>              <tr>                 <td width="30" bgcolor="cc9900" height="16">&nbsp;</td>                <td valign="middle" class="psBotNav" colspan="4" bgcolor="cc3300" height="16"><span class="psBotNavSnd">                   </span><span class="copyBoldBk"><img src="images/main/images/spacer.gif" width="4" height="6"></span><span class="psBotNavSnd">|</span>                   <a href="index.html" class="nav1">HOME</a> <span class="psBotNavSnd">|</span>                   <a href="mailto:mail@pleasantstitch.net" class="nav1">EMAIL                   US</a> <span class="psBotNavSnd">|</span> <a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/2/pleasant_stitch.html" target="new" class="nav1">SONGS</a> <span class="psBotNavSnd">|</span> <a href="mixed.html" class="nav1">MIXED                   MEDIA</a> <span class="psBotNavSnd">|</span> <a href="upShows.html" class="nav1">INFORMATION</a>                   <span class="psBotNavSnd">|</span> <a href="store.html" class="nav1">STORE</a>                   <span class="psBotNavSnd">|</span> </td>              </tr>            </table>          </td>        </tr>      </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF">     <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table></body></html>
